In this project, we will use the CalTech101 dataset, which is a standard dataset used for image classification.
You can find important information about this dataset at (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/). From that webpage, download the dataset
itself (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/101_ObjectCategories.tar.gz) which is some 126 MB and also the annotations
(http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/Annotations.tar) which is some 13 MB and which will allow us to focus our feature extraction on only the objects in the images. Extract the image
dataset and the annotations in your working directory. 

The images will extract to a 101_ObjectCategories/ directory, under which there are 102 directories named according to the
object contained in the image (e.g., accordion/ or pizza/), under which are files with file format image_XXXX.jpg, where XXXX is a four digit number. The annotations will extract to an
Annotations/ directory, underneath which there are 101 directories named the same categories (for the most part) as the 101_ObjectCategories/ categories, under which are files
annotation_XXXX.mat, where XXXX is a four digit number.
